## Hi there 👋

<!--
**KingBright/KingBright** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...

Thinking is important, and after that moving is even more important.

- A programmer, with lots of curiosity.
- A formerly Android developer, not very skilled frontend and backend developer.
- Learning && using rust now, and it's really hard for me.
- Learning computer graphics, and it's even harder.
- Planning to make a game of myself.
